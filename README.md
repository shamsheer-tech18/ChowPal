# ChowPal
ChowPal is a community-driven cooking and grocery marketplace that seamlessly connects recipe discovery, ingredient sourcing, and local ethnic stores in one platform. Unlike existing grocery delivery or social recipe apps, we offer culturally credible meal personalization and direct ingredient integration, making cultural cooking effortless, accessible, and emotionally grounding for students living away from home.

For international students and culturally diverse home cooks who struggle to access authentic ingredients and trusted cultural recipes, ChowPal can be a one-stop solution.
